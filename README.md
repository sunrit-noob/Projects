The files present in this repository are of my self projects

Portfolio_Analysis_Project_1.ipynb contains the code for the Portfolio Analysis Project.
The file with the same name but extension.pptx contains the basis and idea of the project along with the results obtained.

Similarly the Stock_Data_Visualization_Project_2.ipynb contains the code and the file with same name but .pptx extension contains the idea and results of the project.

The CSV files mostly contain the data for each project, but most of the data will be downloaded using yfinance during running both the program files.
